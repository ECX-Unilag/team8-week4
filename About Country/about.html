    <h2>ABOUT NIGERIA</h2>
    <hr>
    <div class="section2">
        <div class="text"><p>THE HISTORY OF NIGERIA CAN BE TRACED TO SETTLERS TRADING ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA AS EARLY AS 100BC. NUMEROUS ANCIENT AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS SETTLED IN THE REGION THAT IS KNOWN TODAY AS NIGERIA, SUCH AS THE KINGDOM OF NRI, THE BENIN EMPIRE, AND THE OYO EMPIRE (1385 AD) DURING THE 11TH CENTURY. WHILE CHRISTIANITY CAME TO NIGERIA IN THE 15TH CENTURY THROUGH AUGUSTINIAN AND CAPUCHIN MONKS FROM PORTUGAL. THE SONGHAI EMPIRE ALSO OCCUPIED PART OF THE REGION</p>
        <p>THE HISTORY OF NIGERIA HAS BEEN CRUCIALLY IMPACTED BY THE TRANSATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE, WHICH STARTED IN NIGERIA IN THE LATE 15TH CENTURY. AT FIRST, EUROPEANS CAPTURED PEOPLE WHO LIVED ALONG THE COAST. THE FIRST SLAVE TRADING POST USED BY THE BRITISH AND THE PORTUGUESE IS BADAGRY, A COASTAL HARBOUR. THE CHAINS WHEREE THEY TIED UP YOUNG AND VIRILE PEOPLE STILL STANDS TODAY. LATER, THEY USED LOCAL BROKERS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH SLAVES. THIS ACTIVITY ESCALATED CONFLICTS AMONG THE DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS IN THE REGION AND DISRUPTED OLDER TRADE PATTERNS THROUGH THE TRANS-SAHARAN ROUTE.</p></div>

           <h2>POPULAR TRADITIONS</h2>
           <hr>
           <div class="section4">
            <div class="text"><p>Nigerians tend to be more relaxed about physical contact, so bear in mind that if you are from a western background, you may feel that your personal space is being invaded. People of the same gender will often touch each other on the arms or back whilst having a conversation, and this is considered perfectly normal. Touching between people of different genders is less common, particularly in the Muslim areas in the north of the country. Many aspects of Nigerian customs are defined by traditional family roles. Therefore during a meal it is not uncommon for men, women and children to eat separately, with the men being served first. When sitting down to eat, the honoured guest will be served first, and you should not start eating until they have started. Avoid eating or passing food with your left hand and do not position yourself so that your feet are pointing towards the food. At the end of a meal, a small burp indicates that you are full and have enjoyed the food. Better out than in! If you are eating out in a restaurant, in addition to the above, you should also be aware that you may be seated at a table with strangers. If this happens, then do not feel obliged to start a conversation with them, but continue with your meal as if you were at your own table. Normally the person who invites other people for a meal will also be the one paying. It is appropriate in Nigerian restaurants to tip at about 10%.</p></div>
